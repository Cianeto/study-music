# Types of NNs for music theory

There's a lot of music produced. I want it to be organized into searchable and annotated corpora. 
Eg. all MIDI files, all sheet music, all spotify audio.

## Multimodal

[LLark](https://github.com/spotify-research/llark) crosses an English-language LLM and several embeddings for music to make a chat bot capable of answering questions on a specific audio uploaded. This is a great interface. 

Music theory is more about texts written by people about pieces and genre (books, papers) than coding tools ready to be crossed. So a similar system for music theory can be an English-language LLM fine-tuned on chunks of music theory books along with examples discussed in particular passages fed in some symbolic form (eg. [MidiTok](https://github.com/Natooz/MidiTok)).
