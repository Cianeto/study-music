- Now:
   - I live in Tbilisi, Georgia üá¨üá™
   - I'm not employed and I'm not pursuing a degree
   - I'm working on [a corpus of analyses for NES soundtracks](https://github.com/vpavlenko/chiptheory)
   - I give [lectures](https://t.me/keetezh/945) on music theory in Tbilisi
- I'd be very glad to mentor students willing to do research in music theory üßë‚Äçüéìüî¨

# What is music theory?

Music theory is our knowledge of what musicians and composers do and do not. Also, it's about what listeners hear.

Music can be roughly split into notes (what keys does a pianist press?) and sound (how producers combine effects to create timbres?). I focus on the notes.

The questions I ask:
- In which order do notes go together in different music?
- Are there statistical patterns that musicians regularly apply?
- Do musicians and composers differ in the tools they use?
- Do listeners actually know and hear that?
- Do sequences of notes, chords, motives and form structures represent genres and styles? How?

I care about [all musical cultures](https://github.com/vpavlenko/study-music): not only the classics and not only Western. For me, music theory is 95% theoretical linguistics and 5% mathematics.

I don't care about black box automatic music generation.

# How to start?

Browse topics below. Pick one or design your own. [Reach out to me](https://t.me/vitalypavlenko) to brainstorm over the possible work plan. Start. Iterate.

# Work principles

- Do corpus-based research: choose from 100 to 100k pieces and analyze them to find patterns
- Present the discoveries through web demos rich in audio examples and visual explanations
- Anti-perfectionism: release and demo as soon as there's something to play with
- Work in extremely small iterations. one week is great, one day is even better
- Limit the scope of the very first steps, make a humble MVP on the week one and iterate from there
- Help others with forking and reproducibility: publish the research code in open source repositories with clear setup instructions
- Consider making something publishable in real music theory journals like Music Theory Online
- However, optimize for teaching your friends on what you've discovered
- Listen to the type of music you're researching, even if it's outside of your comfort zone
- However, optimize for working on music that you deeply care about
- Read books and papers to get an idea of how other researchers understand its structure
- Switch back and forth between manual transcription/annotation and large-scale DS/ML processing
- [Write down](https://emusicology.org/index.php/EMR/article/view/8103/6032#:~:text=with%20questions) [questions](https://kb.osu.edu/bitstream/handle/1811/93138/1/FDMC_2021_Huron_005.pdf) before the research

Feel free to adjust them to your taste. I'm happy to navigate you towards reaching this style of research.

For the research and DS/ML, you may use any available ML tools and libraries. For visualizing the results, I personally use Githup Pages + React + TypeScript and I often ask GPT4 for help. I'm happy to help you with this stack (or any other).

Things will be faster if you have some background in music theory. You most likely have one if you've learned to play some instrument before. It's probably enough if you have an idea of what chords are, what's major/minor, what's an octave and a fifth, and if you can potentially play some songs given the chords - maybe on piano, guitar, ukulele or in the DAW. Or at least if you understand how others do that.

The curve to learn other useful concepts like Roman numerals, seventh chords, cadences and modulation can be steep. However, I'm very happy to navigate you through learning it as you proceed with your research.

# Topics

Below I give topics which I care about. I'm happy to work out any other research topics based on your personal interests. It's way better if you scratch your own itch and tackle the questions you can't stand being unanswered anymore. Let's make music structure uncovered, understood and clearly visualized, one question at a time.

## Jazz harmony

## Jazz solos

    - jazz solos?
        - can Prieler's theory or any NN from Impro-visor improve jazz solo transcription on unseen examples?
        - can Prieler's theory help us build a real-time imrpovisation instrument that's fun to use?


## Bass lines

## Classical music

 - MAESTRO
     - can we visualize the real expressiveness on the score?
     - what are the patterns of expression for certain pieces / composers / styles? what's the easy model to teach the real side of it?
     - what are expression fingerprints of certain pianists?

## Pan-Western

 - harmonic evolution across everynoise (v vs V, minor vs major, harmonic rhythm, progressions)
     - can we easily explain how certain genres are different from the others? is this due to instrumentation / production (plugins) or harmony?
       can we extend the everynoise map to include this information?
     - in which genres do certain countries actually have their national fingerprint / style?

## Rock harmony

## Video game music

## Film music

    - movie music
        - can we reliably identify NRT transitions in the soundtrack?
        - is there evolution of usage of them over time?
        - do all composers use them in the same way?
        - do they have stable semantic load? (can we separate "positive"/"negative", sorts of magic?)


## Barbershop quartets

## Balkan music

## Arabic music

## Adhans

## Persian music

## Gamelan
