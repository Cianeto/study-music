Music Theory
===

Rock harmony
---

- [HookTheory](https://www.hooktheory.com/) - A database of many rock songs and some jazz songs and game tunes focused at harmonic analysis. Comes with a melody-harmony online editor [HookPad](https://www.hooktheory.com/videos) and [two must-read online books](https://www.hooktheory.com/books) on pop/rock harmony which explain Roman numeral analysis, secondary chords and modes. You should probably start with those books unless you already have a college degree in music. You can read them in two weeks if you focus enough.

- [David Temperley. The Musical Language of Rock](https://amzn.to/3nK9eSO) - A book that summarizes [a corpus study](http://rockcorpus.midside.com/) of aspects like harmony, melody, rhythm, timbre and form on 200 rock songs. [Also his papers](http://davidtemperley.com/papers/). Also his other books: [The Cognition of Basic Musical Structures](https://amzn.to/3IvaS2I), [Music and Probability](https://amzn.to/3FXBWWu)

- [David Tagg. Everyday Tonality II](http://tagg.org/mmmsp/EverydayTonalityInfo.htm) - The author proves that applying classical harmony framework to all of modern popular Western music gives poor results, and that one must accept the wide existence of music in different modes, scales and non-tertian chord structures on our TV and radio.

General intro and classical harmony
---

The books below give an intro into music notation and are good for a beginner, although they ultimately go pretty far into things like four-part writing, Neapolitan sixth and sonata form. They will probably take a good year or two to study.

- [Steven G. Laitz. The Complete Musician](https://amzn.to/3nKdSAa) - A standard modern book on classical harmony with introduction into a form and XX century techniques. [Audio examples](https://learninglink.oup.com/access/laitz-4e-student-resources) are freely available
- [Andre Mount. Fundamentals, Function, and Form](https://milnepublishing.geneseo.edu/fundamentals-function-form/) - An online book with audio examples
- [Mauro Braunstein. Offtonic Theory](https://offtonic.com/theory/index.html) - An online book that is spiced up with Jewish Chasidic examples (in addition to classical and rock ones)  and an intro into Arabic maqamaat music



YouTube videos with harmonic analysis:
- [David Bennett Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL613D1A6B3C4BBDF2) - A very thorough analysis of carefully picked pieces from different styles.
- [mDecks Mapping Tonal Harmony Pro YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ltni6rPHUk&list=PLt-Oh3MSFwB9ECItA5ED-fcS0PnqPPgr-&index=4) - One should check many of their educational videos. Probably not worth buying the software right away.

Jazz
---

Jazz knowledge roughly splits into three parts: rhythm, harmony and solo. 

### Jazz harmony 

- [Joe Mulholland, Tom Hojnacki. The Berklee Book of Jazz Harmony Kindle Edition](https://amzn.to/3qKoDUT) - A book that describes all traditional concepts of a jazz harmony language
  (secondary dominants, tritone substitution, modal interchange, modulation, modal harmony). Each chapter analyzes a special piece written to 
  showcase the very discussed chapter topic (unlike other books that analyze existing jazz standards). I'm not sure whether a Kindle version comes with a code to access the website with audio recordings of those pieces, the paperback one does.
  
- [The Jazz Standards Progressions Book](https://mdecks.com/jazzstandards.phtml) - Hundreds of popular jazz standards manually analyzed by authors of mDecks to highlight jazz-specific harmonic patterns (tritone substitution, ii-V-s, to-minor, chord scales)

### Jazz solo

- [üé• Jazz Piano Practice Session - Major II V I & Turn Around Licks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57r-M-oXpsc) - Introduction into solo building strategies

- [The Jazzomat Research Project](https://jazzomat.hfm-weimar.de/dbformat/dbcontent.html) - A corpus of transcribed solos


Bach chorales
---

Bach's chorale harmonizations are a reference for everyone studying classical harmony in relation with voice-leading. Harmonizing a chorale melody is a part of [UK college final exam](https://www.rhinegold.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MT10_scheme_KS5_Bach_chorale_harmonisation.pdf).

- [Chris Gill. Harmonising Bach Chorales](https://amzn.to/3rDe1GH) - A short book describing all aspects of pretty regular bach language (at least those 320 chorales written within minor/major modes) - voice-leading, cadences, modulations, chromaticism.

- [David Huron. Voice Leading: The Science behind a Musical Art](https://amzn.to/3FIuIpe) - An accessible scientific explanation for the traditional rules of voice leading, including an account of why listeners find some musical textures more pleasing than others. Introduces the concept of auditory scene and its parsing, explains how ear anatomy leads to masking, cites many other psychoacoustic researches as well as statistical analysis of music corpora.

<img width="600" alt="Screenshot 2022-01-21 at 3 10 44 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1491908/150524973-e60b9db5-3f1b-4385-b0ea-584e341d56c0.png">

- [ChoraleGUIDE](http://www.choraleguide.com/) - A concise explanation of the topic


Advanced classical harmony
---

- [Vincent Persichetti. Twentieth-Century Harmony](https://amzn.to/3AgQgbk) - A book from 1960. [Audio examples on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwRgeNTZ2i6_BA9H4as1srtNKBAzPPjns)



High-level music theory
---

Some of these books feel pretty esoteric even if they are a serious research.

- [David Huron. Sweet Anticipation: Music and the Psychology of Expectation](https://amzn.to/3FNCjmo) - (Published in 2006) Describes decades of research on how people expect the continuation of a certain musical phrase, and how music is balancing on being a mashup of expected and unexpected. The author also developed a set of Unix utilities called [Humdrum](https://www.humdrum.org/) to ground all his future statistical music research work - as far as in late 80s. Feels like the audio examples were promised but never delivered.

- [A Generative Theory of Tonal Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_theory_of_tonal_music) - An attempt to build a linguistic grammar for common-practice (pre-20-century) music. This work is also continued in [the essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_Constraints_on_Compositional_Systems), [the second book](https://amzn.to/3FRzPn1) where the switch from generative grammar to preference rules occurs, and the path is reflected in [the third one](https://amzn.to/3fJCm8p).

Notable instruments
===

- [OP-1](https://teenage.engineering/products/op-1) - A physical device replacing all aspects of the DAW. Best design instantly forces you to chip in - resist! Borrow from a friend, play for three days, then watch it sitting on the shelf for two months, return and buy me a coffee for saving you $1k. [Red Means Recording - Aquamarine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8sMk5KeWvg) and [its arrangement for the symphony orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrjuyXfLD6s).
