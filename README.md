How to study music: a survey of books, resources and courses to study everything about music and sound in the broadest sense.

Music Theory

Rock harmony
---

- [HookTheory](https://www.hooktheory.com/) - A database of many rock songs and some jazz songs and game tunes focused at harmonic analysis. Comes with a melody-harmony online editor [HookPad](https://www.hooktheory.com/videos) and [two must-read online books](https://www.hooktheory.com/books) on pop/rock harmony which explain Roman numeral analysis, secondary chords and modes. You should probably start with those books unless you already have a college degree in music. You can read them in two weeks if you focus enough.

- [David Temperley. The Musical Language of Rock](https://amzn.to/3nK9eSO) - A book that summarizes [a corpus study](http://rockcorpus.midside.com/) of aspects like harmony, melody, rhythm, timbre and form on 200 rock songs 

Jazz harmony
---

- [Joe Mulholland, Tom Hojnacki. The Berklee Book of Jazz Harmony Kindle Edition](https://amzn.to/3qKoDUT) - A book that describes all traditional concepts of a jazz harmony language
  (secondary dominants, tritone substitution, modal interchange, modulation, modal harmony). Each chapter analyzes a special piece written to 
  showcase the very discussed chapter topic (unlike other books that analyze existing jazz standards). I'm not sure whether a Kindle version comes with a code to access the website with audio recordings of those pieces, the paperback one does.

General intro + classical harmony
---

The books below give an intro into music notation and are good for a beginner, although they ultimately go pretty far into things like four-part writing, Neapolitan sixth and sonata form. They will probably take a good year or two to study.
