A survey of books, resources and courses to **study** everything about **music** and sound in the broadest sense


‚ùì Do you know how to enroll in a music theory program after a computer science BSc (without a completed formal music degree)? Please, let me know: cxielamiko@gmail.com, [t.me/vitalypavlenko](https://t.me/vitalypavlenko) (asking for myself)

Music theory
===

Western music languages
---

Music languages can be divided into a number of families. Historically, the most dominant and influencial one is Western family of languages. Its languages share some common traits:
- 12-tone temperament
- major/minor keys
- homophony
- chords in thirds

The languages are (roughly speaking):
- [**Rock**](parts/rock_harmony.md) - probably worst exploring the first, as it's the simplest and pretty popular. It makes sense to start here and expand into other Western languages later on - as they share a lot of concepts.
- [**Classical**](parts/classical_harmony.md)
- [**Jazz**](parts/jazz.md)
- [**Barbershop**](parts/barbershop.md)
- [**Movies/games**](parts/movies_games.md)
- Western regional traditions (eg. Latin American)


[**Advanced topics**](parts/advanced.md) - TODO merge with "advanced classical harmony"

Non-Western music languages
---

Non-Western music languages are different families. As they were developed all over the globe, they don't share many common features.

The families are (roughly speaking):
- [**maqam languages**](parts/maqam_languages.md)
- [**Southeast Asian percussive languages**](parts/se_asian_percussive.md)
- [**Balkan languages**](parts/balkan.md)
- many other traditions

Notable instruments

- [LYRA-8](https://somasynths.com/lyra-organismic-synthesizer/) - An unusual hardware noise-drone-dark-ambient synthesizer with an ability to instantly create horror film soundtrack. It's not MIDI so you play with knobs, not with the keyboard. Upside: no harmony skills required. Downside: harmony skills don't help much. [Watch and listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1upe9_y4KY)

- [OP-1](https://teenage.engineering/products/op-1) - A physical device replacing all aspects of the DAW. Best design instantly forces you to chip in - resist! Borrow from a friend, play for three days, then watch it sitting on the shelf for two months, return and buy me a coffee for saving you $1k. [Red Means Recording - Aquamarine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8sMk5KeWvg) and [its arrangement for the symphony orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrjuyXfLD6s).
