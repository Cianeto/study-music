Where to start
===

1. Go through [Ableton's guide](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/)
2. Explore [Hooktheory's TheoryTab](https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab): search for your favorite songs and anime openings. Honestly [both of their books](https://www.hooktheory.com/books) are top-notch and well worth the money
3. Scroll through Bartosz Ciechanowski's [visualizations](https://ciechanow.ski/sound/) on the essence of sound
4. Skim through [Toby W. Rush's overview](https://tobyrush.com/theorypages/pdf/en-us/the-whole-enchilada-set.pdf) to intensify a fear for classical music theory
5. Listen to [Beethoven's sonata #5 movement #1](https://rawl.vercel.app/edit?a=beethoven_op10no1mov1), also see what we as a society [**know about it**](parts/beethoven_op10no1mov1.md)
6. Stare at [**classical visualizations**](parts/classical_visualizations.md) and [**jazz visualization**](parts/jazz_harmony_visualizations.md) as if you're at Tate

Western music languages
---

Music languages can be divided into a number of families. Historically, the most dominant and influencial one is Western family of languages. Its languages share some common traits:
- 12-tone temperament
- major/minor keys
- homophony
- chords in thirds
- any of the 12 notes can be a tonic

The languages are (roughly speaking):
- [**Rock**](parts/rock_harmony.md) - probably worth exploring the first, as it's the simplest and pretty popular. It makes sense to start here and expand into other Western languages later on - as they share a lot of concepts. By the way, pop music (structure-wise) it a super-genre combining bits of rock, jazz and other stuff
- [**Classical**](parts/classical.md) - the biggest chapter here, as it's the main focus of all research and teaching (despite its unpopularity according to [streaming stats](https://headphonesaddict.com/music-genre-statistics/))
- [**Jazz**](parts/jazz.md)
- [**Barbershop**](parts/barbershop.md)
- [**Movies**](parts/movies.md)
- [**Video games**](parts/vgm.md)
- [**Bach chorales**](parts/bach_chorales.md)
- Other genres like R&B, country, dance electronic, gospel
- Western regional traditions (eg. Latin)

Non-Western music languages
---

Non-Western music languages are different families. As they were developed all over the globe, they don't share many common features.

The families are (roughly speaking):
- [**Maqam languages**](parts/maqam_languages.md)
- [**Southeast Asian percussive languages**](parts/se_asian_percussive.md)
- [**Balkan languages**](parts/balkan.md)
- many other traditions
