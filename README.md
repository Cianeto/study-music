Music theory

Western music languages
---

Music languages can be divided into a number of families. Historically, the most dominant and influencial one is Western family of languages. Its languages share some common traits:
- 12-tone temperament
- major/minor keys
- homophony
- chords in thirds

The languages are (roughly speaking):
- [**Rock**](parts/rock_harmony.md) - probably worst exploring the first, as it's the simplest and pretty popular. It makes sense to start here and expand into other Western languages later on - as they share a lot of concepts.
- [**Classical**](parts/classical_harmony.md)
- [**Jazz**](parts/jazz.md)
- [**Barbershop**](parts/barbershop.md)
- [**Movies/games**](parts/movies_games.md)
- Western regional traditions (eg. Latin American)


[**Advanced topics**](parts/advanced.md) - TODO merge with "advanced classical harmony"

Non-Western music languages
---

Non-Western music languages are different families. As they were developed all over the globe, they don't share many common features.

The families are (roughly speaking):
- [**maqam languages**](parts/maqam_languages.md)
- [**Southeast Asian percussive languages**](parts/se_asian_percussive.md)
- [**Balkan languages**](parts/balkan.md)
- many other traditions
