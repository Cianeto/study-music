Jazz harmony

- [Joe Mulholland, Tom Hojnacki. The Berklee Book of Jazz Harmony Kindle Edition](https://amzn.to/3qKoDUT) - A book that describes all traditional concepts of a jazz harmony language
  (secondary dominants, tritone substitution, modal interchange, modulation, modal harmony). Each chapter analyzes a special piece written to 
  showcase the very discussed chapter topic (unlike other books that analyze existing jazz standards). I'm not sure whether a Kindle version comes with a code to access the website with audio recordings of those pieces, the paperback one does.
