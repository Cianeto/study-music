Why version 2?
===

The first version was mostly build in February 2022. During the next 12 months I've found a lot of different resources that expand 
the learning track for music theory. They should be somehow merged in, but while I'm in progress of that I'll have this doc as a merging to-do.

Many of the resources are announced in https://t.me/keetezh

Schenkerian analysis
---

1. Add http://davidtemperley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/temperley-mts11.pdf as a criticism. Also Temperley's "The Question of Purpose"

Post-tonal theory
---

1. Add Straus Post-Tonal theory
2. Add relevant chapters from Artusi and that music theory website on github.
4. If mentioning Post-Tonal Theory by Forte, surely reference Haimo 1996 as an index of debates around that theory. [Straus is also Fortean](https://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.00.6.1/mto.00.6.1.perry.html)
