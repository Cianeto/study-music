Why version 2?
===

The first version was mostly build in February 2022. During the next 12 months I've found a lot of different resources that expand 
the learning track for music theory. They should be somehow merged in, but while I'm in progress of that I'll have this doc as a merging to-do.

Many of the resources are announced in https://t.me/keetezh

1. Add http://davidtemperley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/temperley-mts11.pdf as a criticism. Also Temperley's "The Question of Purpose"
