Why version 2?
===

The first version was mostly build in February 2022. During the next 12 months I've found a lot of different resources that expand 
the learning track for music theory. They should be somehow merged in, but while I'm in progress of that I'll have this doc as a merging to-do.

Many of the resources are announced in https://t.me/keetezh

Schenkerian analysis (critique only)
---

1. Add http://davidtemperley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/temperley-mts11.pdf as a criticism. Also Temperley's "The Question of Purpose"
2. List several books that are build on Schenkerian principles. (Eg. from the Oxford Studies in Music Theory) - Eg. Schmalfeldt "In The Process of Becoming", Aldwell‚ÄìSchachter, Kostka‚ÄìPayne (the Tonal one)
3. [Emphasize that it's a US thing](https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/105141/why-is-schenker-so-influential-in-us-academia-is-it-the-same-elsewhere)
4. Diergarten/Neuwirth, when publishing a modern study book on form (2019), [explicitly say](https://storage.gmth.de/zgmth/pdf/1034) that, while they base their book on Marx/Ratz/Schoenberg, Darcy/Hepokoski and Caplin, "Strategies  geared  towards  Heinrich  Schenker  are  not  central  to  the  book  (regardless  of  this,  superordinate  frameworks  are  occasionally  included  for  illustration  purposes)"
5. https://sites.google.com/site/euromac2014/programme/4a/mathews
6. Huron 2021 "On the future of music research" on Poetic Scholarship

Post-tonal theory
---

1. Add Straus Post-Tonal theory
2. Add relevant chapters from Artusi and that music theory website on github.
4. If mentioning Post-Tonal Theory by Forte, surely reference Haimo 1996 as an index of debates around that theory. [Straus is also Fortean](https://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.00.6.1/mto.00.6.1.perry.html)
