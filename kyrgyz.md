(Caution: radical oversimplifications below.)

The most popular Kyrgyz traditional instrument is [komuz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komuz). While it's fretless, the tradition around it
isn't part of maqam traditions, the music is rather standard diatonic. The standard way of performing on komuz is playing solo. 
Virtuoso players are called _komuzchu_ "комузчу" (plural _komuzchular_ "комузчулар"), they are also composers of new pieces.

There are songs and instrumental pieces. Instrumental pieces are called _küü_ "күү" (plural _küülör_ "күүлөр") and comprise a core of the tradition (standards).
There's around 200 of popular ones, with the core of around 50 is the most popular. Some of them are traditional, some of them are composed
by composers of the 20th century. The names of popular standards [are given here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10yVsZBPEoToMBBkdfk8wBOhoR9nSv9Dm?usp=sharing). Their recordings can be found on YouTube.

The book "Балбай Алагушов. Антология кюу для комуза" (unavailable online, its CDs and DVDs are also unavailable)
contains scores for many of them. [Here's a first part of photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pRBe7Uew42iNw1EMOrnqL0HNyGZU3YNn?usp=sharing) (the second half to be photocopied):

Some speculations (to be carefully verified using the scores):
- pieces are primarily melodic, the melody is performed on two strings using many positions
- sometimes the melody is doubled in thirds, fourths or fifths, other times the third string is used for droning
- melodies are done in diatonic modes, with no strict emphasis on the Western major/minor or functional harmony
- melody usually stays within the small range of notes, rhythm is usually simple, meter may change every bar, the pace of performance is pretty fast. the expressive emphasys is thus on the meter and the right-hand technique 

Speculations came from skimming of [В. Виноградов, Киргизская народная музыка, 1958 г.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19Usu0xekX-lNvx--hN2c0ikXUfsxwWd5?usp=sharing) (not avaiable online).
