Lego
---

"Lego bricks" method is a way to memorize and make sense of structures of jazz chord progressions. 
 It's originated in a work by Conrad Cork "A New Guide to Harmony with LEGO Bricks". It was then further developed by John Elliott in "Insights in Jazz".
 Both books are on sale on [John Elliott's website](https://dropback.co.uk/).
 
It's also implemented in Impro-Visor.
 
Here's a list of resources as mentioned on Bob Keller's [website](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/jazz/):

John Elliott [recorded](https://dropback.co.uk/downloads/free-audio/) some patterns that I've [reordered](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hvslv8cgue2njpg/55_iij_bricks_sorted.mp3?dl=0) by similarity
