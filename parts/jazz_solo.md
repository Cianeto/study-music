Jazz solo
===

There's instructive theory on how to start creating something that can be counted as a jazz solo (probably in a hard bop style) - where to start, tips and tricks, how to grow. It's "craft".

And then there's analysis of what the famous jazz musicians with many years of experience really make their solos of. It's "research".

Because, surprisingly, after you learn some basic advice like "use pentatonics" or "use call-response" or "use licks", once you look at real solo transcriptions, you'll get lost, confused and intimidated as to "what's really going on" and "how to make sense of it all".
