Music composition

- [Scott Jarrett, Holly Day. Music Composition For Dummies](https://amzn.to/3rJ7oCC) - A light overview on motives/phrases, the role of harmony and orchestration, ideal to understand something without graduating from college first. Although the book of Belkin (see below) is also approachable ([the book of Schoenberg](https://amzn.to/3FWr4YN) analyzing Beethoven's sonatas is less so). The companion prerequisite [book on music theory for dummies](https://amzn.to/3rJ6OFd) also exists.
