Persian music
---

The central concept here is [radif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radif_(music)). There are several complete radif recordings, both instrumental (Radif of Persian Music on Tar by Morteza Neydavoud in 6 volumes) and vocal. I haven't yet found the books with transcriptions mentioned in a Bruno Nettl work.
