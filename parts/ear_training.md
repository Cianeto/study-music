Ear training
===

- [Artusi](https://www.artusimusic.com/assignments/demo/) - A huge set of free online courses on ear training (melodic, harmonic, rhythmic dictation), four part-writing and counterpoint where you type notes directly in the browser. (Does it make [Counterpointer](https://www.ars-nova.com/counterpointer3.html) obsolete?)
