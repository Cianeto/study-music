How to learn sight-reading
---

- Sight-read for 20 minutes every day
- Sight-read a lot of really easy stuff. Search for "easy piano classics" and other "easy piano" stuff
- Start by sight-reading in white keys only. Skip pieces that have key signature
- Start by sight-reading melodic pieces with right-hand only. Only sight-read with both hands if you are already fast enough with the right hand

Fingers
---

When I learn a new piano piece from notation, an important step is to choose and write down fingers for all notes. One way is to look at the YouTube performance where the hands are clearly visible and write down the fingers from there. Eg. [videos by Paul Barton](https://www.youtube.com/@PaulBartonPiano/videos)

Yes, pianists really [write down all fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir1G0RyWZfg)
