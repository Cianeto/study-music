How to learn sight-reading
---

- Sight-read for 20 minutes every day
- Sight-read a lot of really easy stuff. Search for "easy piano classics" and other "easy piano" stuff
- Have a lot of short piano pieces ready for reading every day. Search for "solo piano", "songbook", "piano anthology", "vocal selections", "piano pieces"
- Start by sight-reading in white keys only. Skip pieces that have key signature
- Start by sight-reading melodic pieces with right-hand only. Only sight-read with both hands if you are already fast enough with the right hand


Fingers
---

When I learn a new piano piece from notation, an important step is to choose and write down fingers for all notes. One way is to look at the YouTube performance where the hands are clearly visible and write down the fingers from there. Eg. [videos by Paul Barton](https://www.youtube.com/@PaulBartonPiano/videos)

Yes, pianists really [write down all fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir1G0RyWZfg)

- [Jeffrey Swinkin. Keyboard Fingering and Interpretation: Comparison of Historical and Modern Approaches.](https://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1210&context=ppr) The article tells about two styles of fingerings. First is Beethoven/Chopin/Schenker where fingerings are a method of preserving phrasing/dynamics. The other starts with Czerny and optimizes the ease of velocity.
