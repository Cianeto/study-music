Common practice
===

Classical music has three very broad periods:
- [**pre-1650, early music**](early_music.md)
- 1650..1900, so called "common practice period", which is the focus of most traditional manuals on classical music
- 20th and 21st century, which has a huge variety of new techniques and approaches, so that sometimes pieces are idiosyncratic and don't share many language traits with some larger class of pieces

Common practice music has several periods (having different language traits):
- Baroque (a mixture of polyphony and homophony), including Galant (schemata)
- Classical (decline of polyphony)
- Romantic (more chromaticism, prevalence of minor mode)

The books below mostly focus on classical and romantic periods. They give an intro into music notation and are good for a beginner, although they ultimately go pretty far into things like voice-leading in four-part writing, diatonic and chromatic harmony (from Roman numerals to Neapolitan sixth and augmented sixth chords) and overview of forms (sentence, period, binary form, sonata form). They will probably take a good year or two to study. Their core topics are the same, so the difference is primarily in the choice of examples, notation, terms, exercises and appendices.

Form
---


- [William E. Caplin. Analyzing Classical Form](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/acf/) - Focuses solely on works of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, this book teaches a theory of formal functions to analyze the structure of their pieces. [A review](https://mtosmt.org/issues/mto.14.20.1/mto.14.20.1.aziz.html), [a podcast with the author](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB5BN328O-Q)
- A form isn't a fixed theory, rather, different theorists have different approaches on form, which is excellently represented in [William E. Caplin, James Hepokoski, James Webster. Musical Form, Forms, and Formenlehre: Three Methodological Reflections](https://www.amazon.com/Musical-Form-Forms-Formenlehre-Methodological/dp/9058678229)
- [James Hepokoski. Sonata Theory Handbook](https://amzn.to/3GRLHGa) - Focuses on broader set of composers (going deep into 19th century) comparing to Caplin's book, the author narrows the scope to a sonata form. [A Wikipedia article on Sonata Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonata_theory)
