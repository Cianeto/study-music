General intro and classical harmony
===

The books below give an intro into music notation and are good for a beginner, although they ultimately go pretty far into things like four-part writing, Neapolitan sixth and sonata form. They will probably take a good year or two to study.

Post-tonal theory

1. Add Straus Post-Tonal theory
2. Add relevant chapters from Artusi and that music theory website on github.
4. If mentioning Post-Tonal Theory by Forte, surely reference Haimo 1996 as an index of debates around that theory. [Straus is also Fortean](https://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.00.6.1/mto.00.6.1.perry.html)
5. Critique from Michael Buchler
