Pseudoscience
---

Or maybe not. You decide. 

Pseudoscience in music theory is a description of a structure where there's no inherent structure. An attempt to catch patterns in a noise, patterns which are one-off and
don't help in composition. Patterns which don't exist in minds of listeners until they become deeply immersed in your theory.

- [Jonathan Christian Petty. Wagner's Lexical Tonality](https://www.amazon.com/Wagners-Lexical-Tonality-Studies-Interpretation/dp/0773460071). An author claims that keys in Wagner operas bear a wordable meaning, and every key change 
means a new meaning. For some reason, this work doesn't seem to be referenced in any other research and is largely ignored by a scientific community.
The author explicitly mentions that his research is falsifiable.

- Studies that claim that different keys employ different features in composers - I'm not sure that's 100% true. See [Steven Bradley Yan. Aspects of Mozart's Music in G Minor](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/279/1/uk_bl_ethos_254655.pdf) and think for yourself
