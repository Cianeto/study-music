- [David Huron. Sweet Anticipation: Music and the Psychology of Expectation](https://amzn.to/3FNCjmo) - (Published in 2006) Describes decades of research on how people expect the continuation of a certain musical phrase, and how music is balancing on being a mashup of expected and unexpected. The author also developed a set of Unix utilities called [Humdrum](https://www.humdrum.org/) to ground all his future statistical music research work - as far as in late 80s. Feels like the audio examples were promised but never delivered.
