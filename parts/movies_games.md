Movies/games
===

Soundtracks for movies and games is a very broad topic. Of course, a lot of times they are based on the tradition that is implied by the plot, eg. a billiard simulator usually features jazz music.
When they are isolated, they have some distinct features.

For movies, it's a non-functional succession of triads (usually analyzed using Neo-Riemannian theory)

For games, it can be modes like lydian or mixolydian.
