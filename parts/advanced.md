Post-tonal theory
---

1. Add Straus Post-Tonal theory
2. Add relevant chapters from Artusi and that music theory website on github.
4. If mentioning Post-Tonal Theory by Forte, surely reference Haimo 1996 as an index of debates around that theory. [Straus is also Fortean](https://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.00.6.1/mto.00.6.1.perry.html)
5. Critique from Michael Buchler
