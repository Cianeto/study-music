High-level music theory
---

Some of these books feel pretty esoteric even if they are a serious research.

- [David Huron. Sweet Anticipation: Music and the Psychology of Expectation](https://amzn.to/3FNCjmo) - (Published in 2006) Describes decades of research on how people expect the continuation of a certain musical phrase, and how music is balancing on being a mashup of expected and unexpected. The author also developed a set of Unix utilities called [Humdrum](https://www.humdrum.org/) to ground all his future statistical music research work - as far as in late 80s. Feels like the audio examples were promised but never delivered.

- [A Generative Theory of Tonal Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_theory_of_tonal_music) - An attempt to build a linguistic grammar for common-practice (pre-20-century) music. This work is also continued in [the essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_Constraints_on_Compositional_Systems), [the second book](https://amzn.to/3FRzPn1) where the switch from generative grammar to preference rules occurs, and the path is reflected in [the third one](https://amzn.to/3fJCm8p).
