- [LYRA-8](https://somasynths.com/lyra-organismic-synthesizer/) - An unusual hardware noise-drone-dark-ambient synthesizer with an ability to instantly create horror film soundtrack. It's not MIDI so you play with knobs, not with the keyboard. Upside: no harmony skills required. Downside: harmony skills don't help much. [Watch and listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1upe9_y4KY)

- [OP-1](https://teenage.engineering/products/op-1) - A physical device replacing all aspects of the DAW. Best design instantly forces you to chip in - resist! Borrow from a friend, play for three days, then watch it sitting on the shelf for two months, return and buy me a coffee for saving you $1k. [Red Means Recording - Aquamarine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8sMk5KeWvg) and [its arrangement for the symphony orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrjuyXfLD6s).
