Suppose you have a wav/mp3 of Western music and you want to produce a midi.

Well, take [RipX DeepRemix](https://hitnmix.com/remix-software/) and you'll get a certain quality.  


Questions:
- Does it use spleeter? Is demucs better?
- How does it draw precise melodyne-like pitch contours?
- How does it estimate midi notes?
- Does it extract midi notes first and then Q-filters a certain part over it for playback? Or how does it split a part into harmonics/notes in a polyphonic texture?



The rest of this doc focuses on how to build your own RipX from existing tools.

### Demixing

[Demucs v4 (2022)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs) [‚ñ∂Ô∏è](https://www.google.com/search?q=demucs+online) splits into bass, drums, vocals and other. Previously [spleeter (2020)](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter) was widely used - it can do additional fifth stem with piano.




### Beat tracking

Next, you want to get beats and downbeats (measures) - in millisecond timestamps. And verse/chorus/bridge form annotation, ideally. Well, since July 2023 you 
can get [All-in-One (2023)](https://github.com/mir-aidj/all-in-one) [ü§ó](https://huggingface.co/spaces/taejunkim/all-in-one):

There's also a [nice visualizer](https://github.com/tae-jun/music-dissector):

### Pitch recognition

For each of non-drum parts you want pitch recognition. General-purpose SOTA is [Basic Pitch](https://basicpitch.spotify.com/):

#### Piano

Historically, a lot of effort was put specifically into solo piano recognition. So now we have:
