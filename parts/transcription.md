## Audio to midi



### RipX

Suppose you have a wav/mp3 of Western music and you want to produce a midi.

Well, take [RipX DeepRemix](https://hitnmix.com/remix-software/) and you'll get a certain quality. Questions:
- Does it use spleeter? Is demucs better?
- How does it draw precise melodyne-like pitch contours?
- How does it estimate midi notes?
- Does it extract midi notes first and then Q-filters a certain part over it for playback? Or how does it split a part into harmonics/notes in a polyphonic texture?

The rest of this doc focuses on how to build your own RipX from existing tools.
