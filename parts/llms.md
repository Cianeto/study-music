LLMs for music theory
---

LLMs are GPT-4 and such. They know natural languages. In future, they should also know everything about music theory, be able to make Roman numeral 
analysis, analysis of forms. They should convert between ABC notation, kern, MusicXML. And they should be able to compose coherent long pieces in a prompted style.
