# The language of common practice

I.e. the era of the tonal system from 1650 to 1900. 

## Individual piece

### Harmony

At the level of individual bars and beats, we can assign an annotation of Roman numerals:

The Roman numerals are below, the guitar-like chord symbols are above. We use Roman numerals to make the same analysis for any minor or major mode, regardless of its tonic pitch.

In which sense are Roman numerals "real", do we hear them? Are they the actual structure of the piece or are they some esoteric concepts helping us to make sense of a complete noise and chaos?




### Modulations

For every piece of that period we have a music sheet. It gives us some information: through key signature we can understand the mid-level division into keys. 

Local modulations aren't usually notated. We can apply a rough statistical technique to get some (not very accurate) [approximation of local tonalities](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~craig/keyscape/) throughout the piece:

Also, at the very local level there's an "applied chord vs. modulation" dichotomy:
