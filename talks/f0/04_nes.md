# NES


Pick any [NES tune](https://chiptune.app/browse/Nintendo):
- Is it in major/minor Western language?
- Does it conform to chords/melody duality?
   - Are there arpeggiated chords, bass?
   - Is the pattern the same for all chords?
- What's the structure of the melody?
- Does it have form? (AABA, verse-chorus, sentence, melody/solo?)

A direct conversion to midi may lose too much information, including timbral. Eg. each square wave generator has duty cycle control.

- https://chiptune.app/browse/Nintendo/Battle%20Storm - doesn't use square 2 - two voices only
- https://chiptune.app/browse/Nintendo/Crystalis - 25% duty. Overall a great soundtrack
- https://chiptune.app/browse/Nintendo/Crime%20Busters - tune 2 has 25% and 12.5% simultaneously, also a lot of gliding. Also a clear minor/major language with boogie vibe
