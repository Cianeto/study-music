Pick any [NES tune](https://chiptune.app/browse/Nintendo):
- Is it in major/minor Western language?
- Does it conform to chords/melody duality?
   - Are there arpeggiated chords, bass?
   - Is the pattern the same for all chords?
- What's the structure of the melody?
- Does it have form? (AABA, verse-chorus, sentence, melody/solo?)
